# SubSer

## About
SubSer is designed to allow developers to easily create subscriptions. The module is very simple and easy to use. It contains every function needed to create a custom subscription, activate it, and check if it is still active. The best part is that it is completely free. I decided to open-source it since I had no need for it as of the time of writing this.

## Why should you use this module?
It enables the ability to create subscriptions as if SubscriptionService was added to roblox studio. This was made so that you can easily create subscriptions without a built in system. This module is fairly stable and fast. It doesn't affect performance greatly (this is proven with benchmarks). It is so simple and flexible that creating subscriptions is now a breeze.

## Is this an official roblox feature?
No, this module is made by me, a developer. Since roblox hasn't released a SubscriptionService yet, I decided to do it myself. I actually had a project that I was working on that required subscriptions. I made this to enable the ability to easily create and use subscriptions.

## Is this frequently updated?
Yes, I update this whenever I recieve feedback. Submit a pull request if you find an issue or just want to add something to the module. Extensions are allowed however they must be verified by me before being released publicly.
